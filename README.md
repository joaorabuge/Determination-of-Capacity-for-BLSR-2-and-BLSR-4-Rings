## Telecommunications Networks Project

### Academic Year: 2022/2023

### Department of Information Sciences and Technologies

### Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a bidirectional SDH ring network consisting of 6 nodes (A, B, C, D, E, F), connected in sequence. Traffic is inserted and extracted at each node according to the given traffic matrix. The capacity required for each service on the ring depends on the group number and varies according to the specific traffic matrix provided. The objective is to determine the efficient use of virtual containers (VC-3 and VC-4) to meet the service requirements and ensure adequate network capacity.

### Part I: Logical Ring Representation and Virtual Container Selection

1. **Graphical Representation**:
   - Create a graphical representation (graph) of the logical connections maintained by the ring, clearly indicating the ring's logical topology.

2. **Virtual Container Allocation**:
   - Determine the optimal virtual containers required to efficiently provide the services specified in the traffic matrix. When using virtual concatenation, ensure that virtual containers of the same order are used in each high-capacity container. The virtual containers available for use are VC-3 and VC-4.

### Part II: Capacity Calculation for a 2-Fiber SDH Ring

For this section, consider the SDH ring utilizing two fibers with shared protection at the multiplexing section level.

1. **Path Visualization**:
   - Draw all the paths that ensure the specified traffic matrix is supported in a normal operational state of the ring.

2. **Capacity Calculation**:
   - Calculate the total capacity the ring must provide to support the indicated traffic.

### Part III: Capacity Calculation for a 4-Fiber SDH Ring

In this part, consider the SDH ring using four fibers with shared protection at the multiplexing section level.

1. **Path Visualization**:
   - Draw all the paths that ensure the specified traffic matrix is supported in a normal operational state of the ring.

2. **Capacity Calculation**:
   - Calculate the total capacity the ring must provide to support the indicated traffic.

This project provides a detailed analysis of SDH bidirectional ring capacities and virtual container optimization. By following the outlined parts, you will determine the most efficient ways to manage network traffic and ensure robust protection and redundancy.
